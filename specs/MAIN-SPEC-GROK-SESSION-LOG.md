### **Session Summary: Development of PI 3D Graphics Engine Specification and Documentation**

**Session Date and Time**: May 31, 2025, 07:34 PM EDT  
**User**: Developer of the "Pie in the Sky" (PI) 3D Graphics Engine  
**AI Assistant**: Grok 3, built by xAI  

#### **Overview**
This session focused on refining the specification (`MAIN-SPEC.md`) and documentation (`README.md` files) for the PI 3D Graphics Engine, a modular, Java-first (JDK 23+) engine designed for cross-platform 3D graphics development. The session involved updating module structures, renaming packages, adjusting terminology, and adding developer-focused content. Key updates included clarifying module naming, removing jMonkeyEngine references, updating the `Plugin` interface, renaming `AppState` to `App`, and simplifying package structures.

#### **Main Decision Points**

1. **Initial Module Refactor and Naming (First Interaction)**:
   - **Decision**: Split the `pi-engine-core` module into commons and core modules to separate general-purpose types (`pi-engine-commons-math`, `pi-engine-commons-utils`) from engine-specific APIs (`pi-engine-core`).
   - **Naming**: Initially proposed `pi-commons-*` for commons modules (inspired by Apache Commons) and `pi-game-engine-core` for the core module.
   - **Outcome**: Generated updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` with new module structure, including `pi-engine-commons-math` and `pi-engine-commons-utils`, and added `pom.xml` files for these modules.

2. **Module Path and Naming Clarifications (Second Interaction)**:
   - **Decision**: Updated the module path due to domain ownership (`org.piengine` instead of `org.pi`).
   - **Naming Update**: Renamed `pi-commons-*` to `pi-engine-commons-*` (e.g., `pi-engine-commons-math`, `pi-engine-commons-utils`) to align with the `org.piengine` domain.
   - **Package Split**: Split `org.piengine.commons.math` into subpackages (`*.coordinates`, `*.math`, `*.shapes`).
   - **Moved Utilities**: Moved `core.util` to `pi-engine-commons-utils` as `org.piengine.commons.util`, and added `Omnibus` event bus under `org.piengine.commons.util.eventbus`.
   - **Outcome**: Updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` to reflect the new module path and package structure, added a section listing all modules grouped into Base and Plugin Modules.

3. **Correction to Base Modules (Third Interaction)**:
   - **Decision**: Added the missing `org.piengine.core` module to the **Base Modules** section in the specification, describing its role as the main module for the core API and functionality.
   - **Outcome**: Updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` to include `org.piengine.core` in the Base Modules table, with a minor correction noted in the version history.

4. **Further Updates and Refinements (Fourth Interaction)**:
   - **Module Naming Clarification**:
     - **Decision**: Clarified the distinction between Maven artifact IDs (`pi-engine-*`) and Java module descriptors (`org.piengine.*`). Maven artifact IDs remain `pi-engine-*` (e.g., `pi-engine-core`), while Java module descriptors match package names (`org.piengine.*`).
     - **Outcome**: Updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` to reflect this distinction in the module overview and Java modules sections.
   - **Versioning**:
     - **Decision**: Reverted to version 1.0, as the specification hasn’t been publicly published, and removed all prior version history entries except for the initial deployment description.
     - **Outcome**: Updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` to version 1.0, with a single version history entry describing the current deployment state.
   - **Removed jMonkeyEngine References**:
     - **Decision**: Removed all references to jMonkeyEngine, including compatibility notes, feature comparisons, and examples, as PI engine is a standalone solution.
     - **Outcome**: Updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` to remove jMonkeyEngine mentions, simplified the feature comparison table to focus on Unreal Engine.
   - **Plugin Interface Update**:
     - **Decision**: Updated the `Plugin` interface to include `pause()`, `unpause()`, and `initForApp(App app)`, reflecting the new lifecycle methods.
     - **Outcome**: Updated the plugin example in `MAIN-SPEC.md` to include the new methods.
   - **Renamed `AppState` to `App`**:
     - **Decision**: Renamed `AppState` to `App` to avoid confusion with other engines, updating related terms (e.g., `AppManager`, `EditorApp`).
     - **Outcome**: Updated `MAIN-SPEC.md` to reflect the renaming in sections, examples, and glossary.
   - **Deployment Description**:
     - **Decision**: Added a description of the current deployment state (core modules implemented, plugin modules planned).
     - **Outcome**: Included in the version history of `MAIN-SPEC.md`.

5. **Updated `pi-engine` README (Fifth Interaction)**:
   - **Decision**: Rewrote the `pi-engine` README to reflect the updates:
     - Clarified Maven artifact IDs (`pi-engine-*`) vs. Java module descriptors (`org.piengine.*`).
     - Renamed `AppState` to `App` in examples and descriptions.
     - Updated the `Plugin` interface with new methods (`pause()`, `unpause()`, `initForApp(App app)`).
     - Removed jMonkeyEngine references.
     - Set version to 1.0, describing the current deployment state.
   - **Additional Details**:
     - Added sections for prerequisites, project structure, plugin development guide, and troubleshooting.
     - Included a sample POM file for an MVP build, integrating `pi-engine-core`, LWJGL, and SnakeYAML.
   - **Outcome**: Generated an updated `README.md` for `pi-engine`, with a detailed example showing app and plugin lifecycle, event handling, and a minimal POM.

6. **Package Name Simplification (Sixth Interaction)**:
   - **Decision**: Removed the `*.commons.*` segment from package names:
     - `org.piengine.commons.math` → `org.piengine.math`
     - `org.piengine.commons.math.coordinates` → `org.piengine.math.coordinates`
     - `org.piengine.commons.math.shapes` → `org.piengine.math.shapes`
     - `org.piengine.commons.util` → `org.piengine.util`
     - `org.piengine.commons.util.eventbus` → `org.piengine.util.eventbus`
     - `org.piengine.commons.util.concurrent.locks` → `org.piengine.util.concurrent.locks`
   - **Outcome**: Noted the change for the record, as the user has already updated the `README.md` and `MAIN-SPEC.md` documents.

#### **Final Conclusion**
This session successfully updated the PI 3D Graphics Engine's specification and documentation to align with the project’s current state and requirements. The `MAIN-SPEC.md` was revised to version 1.0, reflecting the initial deployment with core modules (`pi-engine-core`, `pi-engine-math`, `pi-engine-util`) and planned plugin modules. Key updates included clarifying module naming (Maven `pi-engine-*` vs. Java `org.piengine.*`), removing jMonkeyEngine references, updating the `Plugin` interface, renaming `AppState` to `App`, and simplifying package names by removing `*.commons.*`. The `pi-engine` README was enhanced with developer-focused details, including a sample POM for an MVP build, a plugin development guide, and troubleshooting tips. The session concluded with a note on the package name change, ensuring all updates are documented for future reference.
